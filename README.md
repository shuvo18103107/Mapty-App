# Mapty-App 
This is a web application where the goal is to log the workouts(running or cycling) for the users in their desired location and set some specifications for their workout accordingly. This application is built using Advanced Javascript with Object-Oriented Programming which uses Geolocation APIs, Browser APIs along with some External libraries.

## Key functionalities:
- Real time geolocation update
- Custom map by leaflet API
- Ability to log a workout(Running or Cycling) to specific location
- If running workout then user can set his/her workout distance, duration, cadence ,then application check the data validation and calculate the pace
- If workout is cycling then user can set his/her workout distance, duration, elevation gain then application check the data validation and calculate the speed.
- All the workout information will appear in a workout list 
- A Map marker will also set on the map for specific workout with date and workout type
- User can click on the workout to move the marker to see his/her different workout info on the map.
- All the workout information will save in the localstorage so that application will not loose its stat in case browser is load.
- Ability to delete all workouts

## Future functionalities: <br>
- Ability to <b>delete</b> a workout
- Ability to <b>edit</b> a workout
- Create <b>'Add Workout'<b> button to better improve the App`s UX and UI.
- Ability to <b>sort</b> workouts by a certain field (e.g. distance)
- <b>Re-build</b> Running & Cycling objects exiting local storage
- More realistic error and confirmation <b>messages</b>
- Ability to position the map to show all workouts [very hard]
- Ability to <b>draw lines and shapes</b> instead of just points [very hard]
- <b>Geocode</b> location from coordinates ("Run in Shymoli, Bangladesh") [ASYNC JS]
- <b>Display weather data</b> for workout time and place [ASYNC JS]
